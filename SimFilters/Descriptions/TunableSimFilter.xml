A score is typically between 0 and 1. A score of 0 means the sim will never be selected, the higher a score is the more likely that sim is to be selected. The score for statistic scoring is based on how close to the 'ideal' value the value for the specified statistic for a sim is. It's a 1 if it's that exact score. It's *near* 0 (though not exactly, because the general idea behind this filter to make it a weight not elimination) as it gets farther from the ideal value and closer to the min or max value. (Note: it uses min_value -1 and max_value + 1 as the min/max values to avoid hitting 0. However the min/max values don't have to be accurate, so you can hit 0 by adjusting the tuned min/max values here as desired.) So if you have it tuned as: min value: 0 max value: 5 ideal value: 5 The resulting score for each integer will be: 0 gives you: 0.17 1 gives you: 0.33 2 gives you: 0.5 3 gives you: 0.66 4 gives you: 0.83 5 gives you: 1 The minimum filter score tuning is simply a floor. Regardless of how low the calculated score is, if it's lower than the minimum filter score the result will simply be replaced with the minimum filter score. So adding a minimum filter score of 0.5 simply results in: 0 gives you: 0.5 1 gives you: 0.5 2 gives you: 0.5 3 gives you: 0.66 4 gives you: 0.83 5 gives you: 1 This optional tunable modifies the spread over which the score is returned (and gets rid of the -1/+1 padding as you can specify the padding in the actual range.) So instead of returning from 0 to 1, where 0 is as far away from the ideal as possible, and 1 is at the ideal value, it'll return the lower value when the statistic is as far away from the ideal value as possible, and the closer you get to the ideal value, the closer the return value will be to the maximum value. So adding a score spread override of 0.5 to 1.0, (instead of a minimum filter score) results in: 0 gives you: 0.5 1 gives you: 0.6 2 gives you: 0.7 3 gives you: 0.8 4 gives you: 0.9 5 gives you: 1 Note: Since, as stated, it's perfectly possible to lie about the min/max value, this result is also possible to achieve with clever tuning: min value of -4 max value of 5 ideal value of 5" group="General">

So adding a score spread override of 0.5 to 1.0, (instead of a minimum filter score) results in: 0 gives you: 0.5 1 gives you: 0.6 2 gives you: 0.7 3 gives you: 0.8 4 gives you: 0.9 5 gives you: 1 Note: Since, as stated, it's perfectly possible to lie about the min/max value, this result is also possible to achieve with clever tuning: min value of -4 max value of 5 ideal value of 5" group="General">

A score is typically between 0 and 1. A score of 0 means the sim will never be selected, the higher a score is the more likely that sim is to be selected. The score for statistic scoring is based on how close to the 'ideal' value the value for the specified statistic for a sim is. It's a 1 if it's that exact score. It's *near* 0 (though not exactly, because the general idea behind this filter to make it a weight not elimination) as it gets farther from the ideal value and closer to the min or max value. (Note: it uses min_value -1 and max_value + 1 as the min/max values to avoid hitting 0. However the min/max values don't have to be accurate, so you can hit 0 by adjusting the tuned min/max values here as desired.) So if you have it tuned as: min value: 0 max value: 5 ideal value: 5 The resulting score for each integer will be: 0 gives you: 0.17 1 gives you: 0.33 2 gives you: 0.5 3 gives you: 0.66 4 gives you: 0.83 5 gives you: 1 The minimum filter score tuning is simply a floor. Regardless of how low the calculated score is, if it's lower than the minimum filter score the result will simply be replaced with the minimum filter score. So adding a minimum filter score of 0.5 simply results in: 0 gives you: 0.5 1 gives you: 0.5 2 gives you: 0.5 3 gives you: 0.66 4 gives you: 0.83 5 gives you: 1 This optional tunable modifies the spread over which the score is returned (and gets rid of the -1/+1 padding as you can specify the padding in the actual range.) So instead of returning from 0 to 1, where 0 is as far away from the ideal as possible, and 1 is at the ideal value, it'll return the lower value when the statistic is as far away from the ideal value as possible, and the closer you get to the ideal value, the closer the return value will be to the maximum value. So adding a score spread override of 0.5 to 1.0, (instead of a minimum filter score) results in: 0 gives you: 0.5 1 gives you: 0.6 2 gives you: 0.7 3 gives you: 0.8 4 gives you: 0.9 5 gives you: 1 Note: Since, as stated, it's perfectly possible to lie about the min/max value, this result is also possible to achieve with clever tuning: min value of -4 max value of 5 ideal value of 5" group="General">

This strategy defines how we want to 'combine' all of those individual relationship evaluations back together into one overall evaluation for the sim. Each strategy also contains an explanation in its tooltip, if you want more details on an individual strategy. Here are some general examples for choosing a strategy. For our first example, lets say we are looking at Bob, who has a spouse and two children. Let's also say we have a filter that is looking for any sims who are not married. When looking at Bob, our RelationshipFilterTerm will evaluate the following for each relationship: Spouse: fail Child 1: pass Child 2: pass Since our intention is to filter sims that are not married, we would want our Combine Strategy in this case to fail if any one of the relationships fails. We could use the Match All strategy, since we want to match only if all relationships match. Using the Match All strategy, Bob would fail the filter, since his Spouse relationship fails the filter. Here's another example. Let's say we have Bob again, but this time we're looking for Sims with children. When looking at Bob, our RelationshipFilterTerm will evaluate the following for each relationship: Spouse: fail (not Bob's child) Child 1: pass Child 2: pass Since our intention is to filter sims that have children, we would want our Combine Strategy in this case to pass if any one of the relationships passes. We could use the Match Any strategy, since we want to match with any relationship that matches. Using the Match Any strategy, Bob would pass the filter, since he has at least one relationship that passes the filter. One final example. Let's say that we have Bob again, his spouse is his best friend, but his relationship with Child 1 is not very good. His relationship with Child 2 is neutral. Let's also say that we have a filter that is looking for sims who have friends, and want to bias for sims who have more friends than enemies. We do this by having a 'score' for the evaluation, where 0 is failure, anything non-zero is a 'likelihood' of being selected, where a higher score is better. The max score is 1. With all of that in mind, let's finally say that for our RelationshipFilterTerm evaluates friendship, where enemies would be 0 and best friends are 1. When looking at Bob, our RelationshipFilterTerm will evaluate the following for each relationship: Spouse: 1 (best friends is 1) Child 1: 0.1 (Bob and Child 1 aren't enemies, but it isn't looking good) Child 2: 0.5 (since neutral is halfway between enemies and best friends) Since our intention is to try and find the sim with the most friends and least enemies, we can achieve this by using the Multiply Scores strategy, which is an easy way to combine weights together. Using Multiply Scores, Bob's score would evaluate to 1 * 0.1 * 0.5 = 0.05; a pretty low score! Note: all of the strategies actually work with scores, but the Match strategies just return 0 or 1." group="General">

This strategy defines how we want to 'combine' all of those individual relationship evaluations back together into one overall evaluation for the sim. Each strategy also contains an explanation in its tooltip, if you want more details on an individual strategy. Here are some general examples for choosing a strategy. For our first example, lets say we are looking at Bob, who has a spouse and two children. Let's also say we have a filter that is looking for any sims who are not married. When looking at Bob, our RelationshipFilterTerm will evaluate the following for each relationship: Spouse: fail Child 1: pass Child 2: pass Since our intention is to filter sims that are not married, we would want our Combine Strategy in this case to fail if any one of the relationships fails. We could use the Match All strategy, since we want to match only if all relationships match. Using the Match All strategy, Bob would fail the filter, since his Spouse relationship fails the filter. Here's another example. Let's say we have Bob again, but this time we're looking for Sims with children. When looking at Bob, our RelationshipFilterTerm will evaluate the following for each relationship: Spouse: fail (not Bob's child) Child 1: pass Child 2: pass Since our intention is to filter sims that have children, we would want our Combine Strategy in this case to pass if any one of the relationships passes. We could use the Match Any strategy, since we want to match with any relationship that matches. Using the Match Any strategy, Bob would pass the filter, since he has at least one relationship that passes the filter. One final example. Let's say that we have Bob again, his spouse is his best friend, but his relationship with Child 1 is not very good. His relationship with Child 2 is neutral. Let's also say that we have a filter that is looking for sims who have friends, and want to bias for sims who have more friends than enemies. We do this by having a 'score' for the evaluation, where 0 is failure, anything non-zero is a 'likelihood' of being selected, where a higher score is better. The max score is 1. With all of that in mind, let's finally say that for our RelationshipFilterTerm evaluates friendship, where enemies would be 0 and best friends are 1. When looking at Bob, our RelationshipFilterTerm will evaluate the following for each relationship: Spouse: 1 (best friends is 1) Child 1: 0.1 (Bob and Child 1 aren't enemies, but it isn't looking good) Child 2: 0.5 (since neutral is halfway between enemies and best friends) Since our intention is to try and find the sim with the most friends and least enemies, we can achieve this by using the Multiply Scores strategy, which is an easy way to combine weights together. Using Multiply Scores, Bob's score would evaluate to 1 * 0.1 * 0.5 = 0.05; a pretty low score! Note: all of the strategies actually work with scores, but the Match strategies just return 0 or 1." group="General">

A score is typically between 0 and 1. A score of 0 means the sim will never be selected, the higher a score is the more likely that sim is to be selected. The score for statistic scoring is based on how close to the 'ideal' value the value for the specified statistic for a sim is. It's a 1 if it's that exact score. It's *near* 0 (though not exactly, because the general idea behind this filter to make it a weight not elimination) as it gets farther from the ideal value and closer to the min or max value. (Note: it uses min_value -1 and max_value + 1 as the min/max values to avoid hitting 0. However the min/max values don't have to be accurate, so you can hit 0 by adjusting the tuned min/max values here as desired.) So if you have it tuned as: min value: 0 max value: 5 ideal value: 5 The resulting score for each integer will be: 0 gives you: 0.17 1 gives you: 0.33 2 gives you: 0.5 3 gives you: 0.66 4 gives you: 0.83 5 gives you: 1 The minimum filter score tuning is simply a floor. Regardless of how low the calculated score is, if it's lower than the minimum filter score the result will simply be replaced with the minimum filter score.

So instead of returning from 0 to 1, where 0 is as far away from the ideal as possible, and 1 is at the ideal value, it'll return the lower value when the statistic is as far away from the ideal value as possible, and the closer you get to the ideal value, the closer the return value will be to the maximum value. So adding a score spread override of 0.5 to 1.0, (instead of a minimum filter score) results in: 0 gives you: 0.5 1 gives you: 0.6 2 gives you: 0.7 3 gives you: 0.8 4 gives you: 0.9 5 gives you: 1 Note: Since, as stated, it's perfectly possible to lie about the min/max value, this result is also possible to achieve with clever tuning: min value of -4 max value of 5 ideal value of 5" group="General">

A score is typically between 0 and 1. A score of 0 means the sim will never be selected, the higher a score is the more likely that sim is to be selected. The score for statistic scoring is based on how close to the 'ideal' value the value for the specified statistic for a sim is. It's a 1 if it's that exact score. It's *near* 0 (though not exactly, because the general idea behind this filter to make it a weight not elimination) as it gets farther from the ideal value and closer to the min or max value. (Note: it uses min_value -1 and max_value + 1 as the min/max values to avoid hitting 0. However the min/max values don't have to be accurate, so you can hit 0 by adjusting the tuned min/max values here as desired.) So if you have it tuned as: min value: 0 max value: 5 ideal value: 5 The resulting score for each integer will be: 0 gives you: 0.17 1 gives you: 0.33 2 gives you: 0.5 3 gives you: 0.66 4 gives you: 0.83 5 gives you: 1 The minimum filter score tuning is simply a floor. Regardless of how low the calculated score is, if it's lower than the minimum filter score the result will simply be replaced with the minimum filter score. So adding a minimum filter score of 0.5 simply results in: 0 gives you: 0.5 1 gives you: 0.5 2 gives you: 0.5 3 gives you: 0.66 4 gives you: 0.83 5 gives you: 1 This optional tunable modifies the spread over which the score is returned (and gets rid of the -1/+1 padding as you can specify the padding in the actual range.) So instead of returning from 0 to 1, where 0 is as far away from the ideal as possible, and 1 is at the ideal value, it'll return the lower value when the statistic is as far away from the ideal value as possible, and the closer you get to the ideal value, the closer the return value will be to the maximum value. So adding a score spread override of 0.5 to 1.0, (instead of a minimum filter score) results in: 0 gives you: 0.5 1 gives you: 0.6 2 gives you: 0.7 3 gives you: 0.8 4 gives you: 0.9 5 gives you: 1 Note: Since, as stated, it's perfectly possible to lie about the min/max value, this result is also possible to achieve with clever tuning: min value of -4 max value of 5 ideal value of 5" group="General">

A score is typically between 0 and 1. A score of 0 means the sim will never be selected, the higher a score is the more likely that sim is to be selected. The score for statistic scoring is based on how close to the 'ideal' value the value for the specified statistic for a sim is. It's a 1 if it's that exact score. It's *near* 0 (though not exactly, because the general idea behind this filter to make it a weight not elimination) as it gets farther from the ideal value and closer to the min or max value. (Note: it uses min_value -1 and max_value + 1 as the min/max values to avoid hitting 0. However the min/max values don't have to be accurate, so you can hit 0 by adjusting the tuned min/max values here as desired.) So if you have it tuned as: min value: 0 max value: 5 ideal value: 5 The resulting score for each integer will be: 0 gives you: 0.17 1 gives you: 0.33 2 gives you: 0.5 3 gives you: 0.66 4 gives you: 0.83 5 gives you: 1 The minimum filter score tuning is simply a floor. Regardless of how low the calculated score is, if it's lower than the minimum filter score the result will simply be replaced with the minimum filter score. So adding a minimum filter score of 0.5 simply results in: 0 gives you: 0.5 1 gives you: 0.5 2 gives you: 0.5 3 gives you: 0.66 4 gives you: 0.83 5 gives you: 1 This optional tunable modifies the spread over which the score is returned (and gets rid of the -1/+1 padding as you can specify the padding in the actual range.) So instead of returning from 0 to 1, where 0 is as far away from the ideal as possible, and 1 is at the ideal value, it'll return the lower value when the statistic is as far away from the ideal value as possible, and the closer you get to the ideal value, the closer the return value will be to the maximum value. So adding a score spread override of 0.5 to 1.0, (instead of a minimum filter score) results in: 0 gives you: 0.5 1 gives you: 0.6 2 gives you: 0.7 3 gives you: 0.8 4 gives you: 0.9 5 gives you: 1 Note: Since, as stated, it's perfectly possible to lie about the min/max value, this result is also possible to achieve with clever tuning: min value of -4 max value of 5 ideal value of 5" group="General">

A score is typically between 0 and 1. A score of 0 means the sim will never be selected, the higher a score is the more likely that sim is to be selected. The score for statistic scoring is based on how close to the 'ideal' value the value for the specified statistic for a sim is. It's a 1 if it's that exact score. It's *near* 0 (though not exactly, because the general idea behind this filter to make it a weight not elimination) as it gets farther from the ideal value and closer to the min or max value. (Note: it uses min_value -1 and max_value + 1 as the min/max values to avoid hitting 0. However the min/max values don't have to be accurate, so you can hit 0 by adjusting the tuned min/max values here as desired.) So if you have it tuned as: min value: 0 max value: 5 ideal value: 5 The resulting score for each integer will be: 0 gives you: 0.17 1 gives you: 0.33 2 gives you: 0.5 3 gives you: 0.66 4 gives you: 0.83 5 gives you: 1 The minimum filter score tuning is simply a floor. Regardless of how low the calculated score is, if it's lower than the minimum filter score the result will simply be replaced with the minimum filter score. So adding a minimum filter score of 0.5 simply results in: 0 gives you: 0.5 1 gives you: 0.5 2 gives you: 0.5 3 gives you: 0.66 4 gives you: 0.83 5 gives you: 1 This optional tunable modifies the spread over which the score is returned (and gets rid of the -1/+1 padding as you can specify the padding in the actual range.) So instead of returning from 0 to 1, where 0 is as far away from the ideal as possible, and 1 is at the ideal value, it'll return the lower value when the statistic is as far away from the ideal value as possible, and the closer you get to the ideal value, the closer the return value will be to the maximum value. So adding a score spread override of 0.5 to 1.0, (instead of a minimum filter score) results in: 0 gives you: 0.5 1 gives you: 0.6 2 gives you: 0.7 3 gives you: 0.8 4 gives you: 0.9 5 gives you: 1 Note: Since, as stated, it's perfectly possible to lie about the min/max value, this result is also possible to achieve with clever tuning: min value of -4 max value of 5 ideal value of 5" group="General">

This strategy defines how we want to 'combine' all of those individual relationship evaluations back together into one overall evaluation for the sim. Each strategy also contains an explanation in its tooltip, if you want more details on an individual strategy. Here are some general examples for choosing a strategy. For our first example, lets say we are looking at Bob, who has a spouse and two children. Let's also say we have a filter that is looking for any sims who are not married. When looking at Bob, our RelationshipFilterTerm will evaluate the following for each relationship: Spouse: fail Child 1: pass Child 2: pass Since our intention is to filter sims that are not married, we would want our Combine Strategy in this case to fail if any one of the relationships fails. We could use the Match All strategy, since we want to match only if all relationships match. Using the Match All strategy, Bob would fail the filter, since his Spouse relationship fails the filter. Here's another example. Let's say we have Bob again, but this time we're looking for Sims with children. When looking at Bob, our RelationshipFilterTerm will evaluate the following for each relationship: Spouse: fail (not Bob's child) Child 1: pass Child 2: pass Since our intention is to filter sims that have children, we would want our Combine Strategy in this case to pass if any one of the relationships passes. We could use the Match Any strategy, since we want to match with any relationship that matches. Using the Match Any strategy, Bob would pass the filter, since he has at least one relationship that passes the filter. One final example. Let's say that we have Bob again, his spouse is his best friend, but his relationship with Child 1 is not very good. His relationship with Child 2 is neutral. Let's also say that we have a filter that is looking for sims who have friends, and want to bias for sims who have more friends than enemies. We do this by having a 'score' for the evaluation, where 0 is failure, anything non-zero is a 'likelihood' of being selected, where a higher score is better. The max score is 1. With all of that in mind, let's finally say that for our RelationshipFilterTerm evaluates friendship, where enemies would be 0 and best friends are 1. When looking at Bob, our RelationshipFilterTerm will evaluate the following for each relationship: Spouse: 1 (best friends is 1) Child 1: 0.1 (Bob and Child 1 aren't enemies, but it isn't looking good) Child 2: 0.5 (since neutral is halfway between enemies and best friends) Since our intention is to try and find the sim with the most friends and least enemies, we can achieve this by using the Multiply Scores strategy, which is an easy way to combine weights together. Using Multiply Scores, Bob's score would evaluate to 1 * 0.1 * 0.5 = 0.05; a pretty low score!

A score is typically between 0 and 1. A score of 0 means the sim will never be selected, the higher a score is the more likely that sim is to be selected. The score for statistic scoring is based on how close to the 'ideal' value the value for the specified statistic for a sim is. It's a 1 if it's that exact score. It's *near* 0 (though not exactly, because the general idea behind this filter to make it a weight not elimination) as it gets farther from the ideal value and closer to the min or max value. (Note: it uses min_value -1 and max_value + 1 as the min/max values to avoid hitting 0. However the min/max values don't have to be accurate, so you can hit 0 by adjusting the tuned min/max values here as desired.)

So instead of returning from 0 to 1, where 0 is as far away from the ideal as possible, and 1 is at the ideal value, it'll return the lower value when the statistic is as far away from the ideal value as possible, and the closer you get to the ideal value, the closer the return value will be to the maximum value. So adding a score spread override of 0.5 to 1.0, (instead of a minimum filter score) results in: 0 gives you: 0.5 1 gives you: 0.6 2 gives you: 0.7 3 gives you: 0.8 4 gives you: 0.9 5 gives you: 1 Note: Since, as stated, it's perfectly possible to lie about the min/max value, this result is also possible to achieve with clever tuning: min value of -4 max value of 5 ideal value of 5" group="General">

So adding a score spread override of 0.5 to 1.0, (instead of a minimum filter score) results in: 0 gives you: 0.5 1 gives you: 0.6 2 gives you: 0.7 3 gives you: 0.8 4 gives you: 0.9 5 gives you: 1 Note: Since, as stated, it's perfectly possible to lie about the min/max value, this result is also possible to achieve with clever tuning: min value of -4 max value of 5 ideal value of 5" group="General">

A score is typically between 0 and 1. A score of 0 means the sim will never be selected, the higher a score is the more likely that sim is to be selected. The score for statistic scoring is based on how close to the 'ideal' value the value for the specified statistic for a sim is. It's a 1 if it's that exact score. It's *near* 0 (though not exactly, because the general idea behind this filter to make it a weight not elimination) as it gets farther from the ideal value and closer to the min or max value. (Note: it uses min_value -1 and max_value + 1 as the min/max values to avoid hitting 0. However the min/max values don't have to be accurate, so you can hit 0 by adjusting the tuned min/max values here as desired.) So if you have it tuned as: min value: 0 max value: 5 ideal value: 5 The resulting score for each integer will be: 0 gives you: 0.17 1 gives you: 0.33 2 gives you: 0.5 3 gives you: 0.66 4 gives you: 0.83 5 gives you: 1 The minimum filter score tuning is simply a floor. Regardless of how low the calculated score is, if it's lower than the minimum filter score the result will simply be replaced with the minimum filter score. So adding a minimum filter score of 0.5 simply results in: 0 gives you: 0.5 1 gives you: 0.5 2 gives you: 0.5 3 gives you: 0.66 4 gives you: 0.83 5 gives you: 1 This optional tunable modifies the spread over which the score is returned (and gets rid of the -1/+1 padding as you can specify the padding in the actual range.)
