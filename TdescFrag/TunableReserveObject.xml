        <TunableTuple class="TunableReserveObject" description="Control which objects are marked as reserved for in use and how. When setting this value, consider these rules: * Sims may never be marked as in use. Do not try to reserve TargetSim, nor you should try to reserve Object if the interaction may run on Sims. * You may not use a 'basic' reservation if you wish to reserve an entire object and that object has parts. In that case, you must use an 'all' reservation. e.g. Sit Sims sit down, and may do so on individual parts of the sofa. Because the interaction targets the part specifically, we use a 'basic' reservation to reserve that and only that part. e.g. Possess Ghosts may possess objects and have them shake. Since they might possess the sofa (in its entirety), we want to use the 'all' reserve type to mark the object, as well as each individual part as reserved for use. This would prevent other Sims from sitting down while the object is being possessed. Note: it is valid to use the 'all' reserve type on any object, not just objects with parts!" group="General">
