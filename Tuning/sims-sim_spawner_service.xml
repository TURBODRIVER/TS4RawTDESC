The actual value of the NPC soft cap will be this tuning value minus the number of sims in the active household. There is no hard cap because certain types of NPCs must always spawn or the game will be broken. The prime example of a game breaker is the Grim Reaper. If the number of NPCs is: 1) At or above the soft cap only game breaker NPCs will be spawned. 2) Above the soft cap then low priority NPCs will be driven from the lot. 3) Equal to the soft cap and there are pending requests for higher priority NPCs, then lower priority NPCs will be driven from the lot.
