This is used to make some objects more attractive than others for the purposes of posture preference scoring. That means that higher numbers are good; the Sim will go x meters out of their way to use these objects, where x is the amount tuned. For example, if one object has a score of 3 and another object has a score of 0, the object that scores 0 will need to be more than 3 meters closer than the object that scores 3 for the Sim to choose it. Example: Let's say you want to make couches more desirable for watching TV. To do this, you would create a new tag in PostureTransitionTargetPreferenceTag (found in Tuning->postures) called 'ComfortableSeating'. Then you would tag all appropriate objects with that tag by adding it to PosturePreferenceTagList on the object. Next, you would come in here and add a new item with a key of that tag and a value of 10 or so, which is about the size of the constraint to watch TV. Thus they will tend to use couches in the TV cone at the expense of other factors. One example downside of this is they will be less inclined to consider how centered they are in the TV cone and what direction the sofa is facing." group="General">
