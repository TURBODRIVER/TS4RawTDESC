Surfaces are usually used as additional actors in ASMs (for instance, the eat ASM has a table actor in addition to the sitTemplate/chair and sim). Generally speaking, this should be checked when a sim might need to interact with this slot. Examples are food slots, deco slots sims can put things into, and similar. This should not be checked when a slot is used only for build-buy or is un-interactable. Examples are slots for chairs (unless we add the ability for sims to place chairs), slots for modular furniture, and deco(rative) slots that are not sim-interactable." group="General" />
