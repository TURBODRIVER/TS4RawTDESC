The big difference between this and a regular SalesTableVendorSituation is that a Sim added to this situation creates an object relationship with an object essentially claiming it. The Sim can then push interactions and have the role_state_overrides change the target automatically or can be tested against to gate certain interactions to only work if the Sim has claimed the object. The Sim must be able to make an object relationship with an object or the situation will self_destruct thinking it has no object to staff.
